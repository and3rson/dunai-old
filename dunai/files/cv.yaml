bio:
  - >
      I love interesting & crazy stuff, clean reusable code, maintainable scalable hi-load architectures, shells, vim, tmux, awesomewm, drones, IoT, Doom game series, UT99, multiplayer game hacking, OpenSource, heavy/thrash/stoner metal, traveling, snowboarding & random adventures.
  - >
      I like to pursuit fresh ideas, to be precise in my profession & to be verbose in communication.
  - >
      I've been coding for around 11 years and experienced a lot of technologies. My belief is that every task requires a specific set of tools and technologies in order to be solved efficiently. That's why I often switch mainly between Python, JS, C, Java and Go (sorted by experience.)

      I administered three cooperating Joomla-driven portals.
      I implemented Single Sign-On for thousands of users that were registered on those three websites.
      It took some time to implement a bulletproof logic for allowing users to register on any of these portals
      and then easily switch between the three of them.
      I also did numerous updates to the frontend and administrator portal backend.

      I created customer area portal from scratch (backend + frontend). It was an application that granted privileged
      users to access & manage their financial information using internet.
      I also replaced existing call center operator software with a new one that allowed us
      to orchestrate 350 internal workspaces remotely and easily perform mass OTA updates.
      I refactored existing internal dial plan management system that used asterisk SIP (Asterisk) and which handled
      over 1,000,000 phone calls a month.
      I eliminated existing memory usage issues & file descriptor (that were initially caused by abusing threads) leaks
      which allowed us to run the server continuously for months without having to restart it every 20 minutes as before.
      I also developed a fork of "Twinkle" SIP client (written in Qt) that we called "Sparkle". It was using a
      modified & simplified UI and gave the operators more control over their calls.
